########################
Deliverable 1: Use-cases
########################

This page describes the standardized use-cases that were used in defining requirements and responding to the other charge questions.
They will be referred (and linked) to throughout this report.
The use-cases are separated into two categories.
The first set describes the use-cases that exemplify functionalities required to perform on-the-fly analyses and alert users.
The second set is specific to image display capabilities.

.. _pgD1 Use-cases for On-the-fly Analysis and Reporting:

Use-cases for On-the-fly Analysis and Reporting
===============================================

The use-cases for on-the-fly reporting are reported in the following subsections.
They are designed to be as orthogonal as possible but overlap does exist.
Increased detail is given where a unique requirement is going to result from the use-case.
General capabilities and existing functionality is given significantly less attention.


Mount Jitter Measurement and Reporting
--------------------------------------

For the moment, the `Jitter use-case is hosted on confluence <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=LSSTCOM&title=Mount+Jitter+Use-Case>`_.

This is a response to Question 1, and a reference to :ref:`pgD1 Use case1`.


Afternoon Calibration Generation
--------------------------------

For the moment, the `Afternoon Calibration Generation use-case is hosted on confluence <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LSSTCOM/Use+Cases+for+Calibration+Generation>`_.

Automated Fault Report Use-Case
--------------------------------

For the moment, the `Automated Fault Report Use-Case use-case is hosted on confluence <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LSSTCOM/Automated+Fault+Report+Use-Case>`_.
This use-case is to emphasize that there will be a demand for running analyses and generating artifacts that are not associated with images.


Active Optics System
--------------------

For the moment, the `Active Optics System Use-Case use-case is hosted on confluence <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=156512863>`_.
Much of this use-case was based on use-cases from the DECam Active Optics System.


Observer Data Summary Feedback
------------------------------

Significant input was provided regarding the display of feedback to the observer, many of which were from the Scheduler.
This was intentionally left for a later date and any specific architectural requirements that came out of this have been incorporated into the other use-cases.




Use-cases for Image Display Capabilities
========================================

Use-case 3
----------

This is a response to Question 1, and a reference to :ref:`pgD1 Use case1`.
